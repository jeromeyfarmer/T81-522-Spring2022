## Retrieving data 

Data science students usually learn modeling skills with processed and cleaned data in text files stored on their laptop. However, in the real world, the data comes from various sources and in wide ranging formats.

In this week, we will learn about how to get data into Python from three common sources:

**Web-APIs**

Since web API might be an unfamiliar concept to many students in the class, we will first go through briefly what it is. Then we will learn how to interact with web APIs using a tool called Postman. Finally, we will learn how to get data from API endpoints and parse the data in Python.

**Databases**

In industries, enterprise data is mainly made available by database management system (DBMS). While there are wide ranging DBMS and are hosted in different types of environments and servers, the way to access them from python is pretty consistent across database specific Python libraries. We will learn about how to connect to a PostgreSQL database and fetch data using the `psycopg2` library in Python.

**Text files**

Finally, we will also learn how to read data in a text file using inbuilt python functions.
