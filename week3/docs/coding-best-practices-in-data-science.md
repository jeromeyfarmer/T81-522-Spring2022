## Learning Objective

In this week, students will learn the best practices and standards in python programming and documenting data science projects. They will also learn various methods and tools to make codes readable, replicable, and reproducible.


## Reproducibility and replicability


`Reproducibility`: The ability to produce the same or very close result by others with the exact methods and dataset

`Replicability`: The ability to independently obtain similar results independently of the original investigator without the use of original data but with similar methods

To achieve reproducibility and replicability goals in data science, we need to follow the best practices and standards in all stages of project lifecycle. In this week, we focus on the relevant topics in relation to coding in python.



## Most data scientists are not very well known for high quality coding

- They come from various backgrounds and the majority of them lack prior software development and collaborative programming experience

- They work with more proof-of-concept and prototype building (not production) mindset.

- They run multiple experiments and most of the methods and results never see the light of the day.


## Reasons for incorporating the best practices


- Enables reproducibility and replicability as above discussed

- Allows for smooth integration of the data science product into production

- Allows for timely identification of bugs in the software

- Improves reusability of the codes in other projects

- Helps smooth future handover of the projects to other teams or newcomers

- Foster better communication as industry data science is a highly collaborative process
