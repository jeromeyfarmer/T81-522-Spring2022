Models in data science can be grouped into different categories. The following categories are neither exahaustive nor exclusive. There are other ways of thinking about models, and some models could easily overlap into different categories. 

1. [Model categories by purpose](types-by-purpose.md):

- Segmentation

- Prescriptive

2. [Model categories by frameworks](types-by-framework.md):

- Statistical

3. [Model categories by interpretability](types-by-interpretability.md):
