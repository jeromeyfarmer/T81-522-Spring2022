### What is a model?

"What exactly is a model and what purposes does it serve? I venture to suggest that ten model builders will give at least five different, or at least, apparantly different answers to the question" - `May Brodbeck`
 
- A representation of a real world
- Model is always a simplied version of reality and thus leaves some information out 

_"All models are wrong but some are useful"_ - `George Box`

_"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."_ - `Albert Einstein`

Models serve one or more of the following functions depending upon the way they are constructed.

- Understand causal link among variables  (**causal**)
- Establish relationship among variables (**inferential**)
- Identify patterns and trends - regularities and anamolies (**descriptive**)
- Predict the future scenarios (**predictive**)
- Identify the best course of actions (**prescriptive**)
 
In general, there are two typyes of representational models:

1. **Process-based**

- Based upon an understanding of the underlying mechanistics process 
- Could be either conceptual or mathematical
- E.g., double helix DNA model, radiative transfer model, ecosystem models


2. **Empirical model**

- Based upon observations (data)
- Mathmatical equations are used to link observed variables of interest in the data
- e.g., statistical, machine learning models

### Models in data science

- Models in data science are empirical in nature. 
- The end goal of a model is to inform one or more business decisions.
- The model building process starts with a critical business question that needs answering. 
- Answering a business question doesn't always need model development - descriptive statistics and data visualization suffice in many instances
- Determining and collecting right kind and amount of data useful to answer the business question is the most critical part of model development
