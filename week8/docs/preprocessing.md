### Preprocessing

In the previous week, we learnt various ways of exploring and understanding our data. Now we are one step closer to building predictive models. Before that, however, we need to preprocess the dataset based upon the knowledge gained from EDA to make them suitable to modelling.

Data hardly comes in the shape and form necessary for the performance of a machine learning algorithm. While preprocessing data is a crucial step, the level and types of preprocessing required might vary with the learning algorithm at hand. For example, Some algorithms might require the features are on the same scale for better performance. Some algorithms can handle missing values in data during runtime, whereas, others require missing values are treated before model building. General preprocessing steps that we are going to cover in this week include:

- Handling missing values
- Resampling of imbalanced dataset
- Standardization and binning
- Categorical encodings
- Feature transformation
