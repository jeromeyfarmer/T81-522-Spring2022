# Course Description

Machine Learning studies representations and algorithms that allow machines to improve their performance on a task from experience. Machine learning is all about finding patterns in data to get computers to solve complex problems. Instead of explicitly programming computers to perform a task, machine learning lets us program the computer to learn from examples and improve over time without human intervention. This requires addressing a difficult question: how to generalize beyond the examples that have been provided at "training time" to new examples that you see at "test time". 

Machine learning is an exciting and fast-moving field with many recent consumer applications (e.g., Microsoft Kinect, Google Translate, iPhone's Siri, digital camera face detection, Netflix recommendations, Google news) and applications within the sciences and medicine (e.g., predicting protein-protein interactions, species modeling, detecting tumors, personalized medicine). This course builds on students’ mathematical, programming, and problem-solving skills and knowledge in the field of machine learning. Students will expand their knowledge in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and how to apply machine learning to solve new problems. 

The course will focus on the two major paradigms in machine learning - supervised and unsupervised learning.  This course will show students how generalization processes can be formalized and implemented. We will look at machine learning from many different perspectives, illustrating the key concepts in the field.  The core objective of this class is to provide a rigorous training on the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and theories in machine learning. The lectures will cover perceptron/linear models, projection/nonlinear embedding methods, Bayes methods, neural networks/deep learning, parametric/non-parametric methods, kernel machines, hidden Markov models, reinforcement learning, mixture models and graphical models.  

After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:

•	Understand key concepts in machine learning
•	Use acquired hands-on experiences with implementation of machine learning algorithms
•	Derive the mathematical formulation of the fundamental machine learning models
•	Formulate and solve application questions with appropriate machine learning methods
